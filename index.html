        <p style="align-content: justify">
           You're beautiful. Ever since I saw you, I knew you were the one for me. I know I love you because I see you every way turn-no matter what I'm doing. I know  I want to be with you, not just with you, but share everything with you, too. Just being close to you is not enough for me. I want to be apart of your world; A part fo your life forever. I never have to wonder if you love me back. You complete me-my heart and my soul.</p>
        <br>
        <p style="align-content: justify">
            You're my best friend, my lover, and my soulmate, You have been there and supported me through and through. I feel lost without you. There are no words to describe how much I love you. IT's hard to picture a day without talking-seeing you. You are perfect.</p>
        <br>
        <p style="align-content: justify">
            You're the reason why I try my best, to try my hardest to succeed. I learn more more from you everyday. Saying a "I love you" feels powerful but not enough. You took my life and turned it for the best. I'll say it again, you're beautiful. You may need feel like it but know that isn't true. </p>
